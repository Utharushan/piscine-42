# Ecole 42
Ã‰cole 42, founded by Xavier Niel in 2013, is an innovative, tuition-free coding school based in Paris with global campuses.\
It emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and project-based curriculum, focusing on real-world skills.\
Admission is based on potential and motivation, not academic background.\
Candidates undergo an intensive four-week selection process called "La Piscine" to demonstrate their aptitude and dedication.\
Graduates are highly sought after in the tech industry for their technical expertise and adaptability.\
The school's unique approach and commitment to accessibility make it a leader in tech education.\

On this repository can be found all the exercises and projects that I've done during the Piscine of July 2024.
