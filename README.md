### What is the Piscine?

The **Piscine** (French for "swimming pool") is an intensive four-week coding bootcamp that serves as the entry point to École 42's program. Participants dive into programming without prior requirements, tackling daily challenges and projects in the C programming language. It’s designed to test adaptability, resilience, and collaboration in a high-pressure environment.

The exercises in this repository focus on building a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, including:
- Mastery of the C language syntax.
- Memory management.
- String manipulation.
- Loops and conditionals.
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

Participants must also adhere to the **42 Norm**, a strict coding standard that enforces clean, structured, and efficient code.
